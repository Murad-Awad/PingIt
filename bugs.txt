Bugs:

!!!!! 
Cannot access setup
Logging in returns to the same page with the login button replaced by the log out button so it's a continuous loop. (Unhandled promise rejection)
!!!!!

Get rid of notifications screen on SidebarScreen
Friends list 
- get rid of header but keep back button
- usually doesn't load friendlist
- what's the join the pack button for???
- when I click on join the pack button with no friends on screen, error that null is not an object is sent

HomeScreen
- Get rid of header (minus back button)

CurrentLocationScreen
- Needs to implement mapview entirely, just a dummy page right now

FeedbackScreen
- text input is nonexistent...should we have this page if we won't use it yet?

If we cannot access the user's location, it sends an error that null is not an object (null coming from either the latitude or longitude)
- maybe handle this error with a separate screen or something asking for location permissions? And if they're out of range then separate screen for nonlocation

When logging out, needs to get rid of the alert that the user logged out (it shows up 2x)
After logged out, the log out button is on the login screen? Need to move it to log out screeN!! (LogOutConfirmScreen)

logged out and logged back in but it was automatic so I didn't put in info...then when I tried to log out again it resulted in it saying "logged in with Facebook" with "Facebook" being the user.

When completely logged out, stuck on splash screen
